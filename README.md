# TWEESKYNET

A Python application that publishes a Twitter report/snapshot for your search handle and hashtag and gets a skylink to share.

TweeSkynet uses Tweepy, one of the most popular Twitter APIs for Python. 
It is mainly used for data mining Twitter.

You will need to get a Twitter developer account so you can pass your Twitter credentials to Twitter and use its APIs such as Accounts, Users and Tweets APIs.

Tweepy is configured to wait when it reaches rate limits.


## Setup
You must install the following packages:
- siaskynet
- PyInputPlus
- tweepy

## Usage
In your terminal run the following command: `python3 tweeskynet.py`

Once you input a twitter handle term and hashtag, the application generates a text file which will be saved locally. And more important it will be published to Skynet with a skylink that you can share with everyone.
